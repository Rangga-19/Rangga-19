    <h1>About Online Scams</h1>
    <p> 
      Online scams are tricks used by criminals to steal your personal details, money, or identity. These scams can show up as emails, messages, or websites that look real, but actually fake. Scammers may pretend to be a bank, or a company, or even a family member to fool you into trusting them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Scams come in many forms, such as fake prize offers, tech support pop-ups, or messages that say you've won money. Some scams ask you to click a link or download something dangerous, while others try to get you to give away private information like your credit card number or password. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone can be a target, but older adults who may be less familiar with the internet are especially at risk. That's why it's important to learn how to spot scams and protect yourself and your loved ones. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Here are some common signs of a scam</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Too good to be true:</strong> You're told you've won something but didn't enter a competition.</li>
      <li><strong>Urgent or threatening messages:</strong> The scammer tries to rush you or scare you into acting quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Request for personal information:</strong> You're asked for bank details, passwords, or IRD number.</li>
      <li><strong>Unusual payment methods:</strong> You're told to pay using gift cards, cryptocurrency, or wire transfer.</li>
      <li><strong>Links or attachments in unexpected messages:</strong> Clicking them can install viruses or lead to fake websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you think something feels off, it probably is. Take your time, ask someone you trust, and never feel presured to respond right away. You can also report scams to help stop them from spreading.
